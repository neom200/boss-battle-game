This project was done in 6 hours, and erros were fixed later.
This game is a simple boss fighting game, where the player has to defeat differente bosses with different sequences of move each.

The common keywords used for the moves are:
'a' = attack
'r' = right (going to the right location)
'l' = left (going to the left location)
'd' = defending
'h' = healing

    [Game Characteristics]

When you start the game, you will choose a name for your character. The game's save system is based on the name, so if there is a save with the same name as the one you chose, the game will ask you if you want to use this existing save or overwrite it with a new one. By default, the game creates a folder called “saves” in the directory where the game's executable is, but just in case, you can create this folder beforehand if you like.

If you create a new save, or overwrite an existing one, you'll have the chance to choose between four classes: Fighter, Priest, Elf and Orc. There are four main attributes that your character has (strength, defense, stamina and life) and each of the classes is focused on being better at one of these attributes: Fighter focuses on strength, Priest focuses on defense, Elf focuses on stamina, and Orc focuses on life.

In the main menu there is an option to buy items in the store. Money is earned by killing bosses or, when you die to one of them, through a small chance of getting 'pity money'. In the store you can buy weapons, armor and potions. Potions are exclusively for single use and are used to partially restore life during a battle.

During battles, there are two positions in which your character can stand: left (L) and right (R). Bosses have a sequence of movements, which always include attacking from the left, attacking from the right and defending yourself. You avoid attacks from one side if you are on the other.
During battles, there will be some important information next to your name, which will be in the format [Position]:{Life}?{Stamina}@{Potions}. Stamina determines your ability to attack, each attack reduces your stamina by 1 (if you see a “-1” in stamina, ignore it, it's supposed to be zero but it's bugged) and defending boosts your stamina by 1.

You can only fight bosses you haven't defeated yet.

Good luck in your gameplay!
