This project was done in 6 hours, and erros were fixed later.
This game is a simple boss fighting game, where the player has to defeat differente bosses with different sequences of move each.

The common keywords used for the moves are:
'a' = attack
'r' = right (going to/attacking at the right location)
'l' = left (going to/attacking at the left location)
'd' = defending
'h' = healing
'b' = both (when the boss attacks both left and right at the same time)
